# SQL TCL Theory Notes

These are my notes on SQL TCL (Transaction Control Language) from Hitesh Choudhary's videos. I refined them to sound more natural, like my own jottings after watching. TCL is about managing transactions in the databaseâ€”basically, grouping operations so they either all succeed or all fail, keeping things consistent. It's super important for data integrity, especially when multiple operations are involved, like transferring money between accounts.

## What is TCL?

TCL stands for Transaction Control Language. It's used to control the execution of transactions in SQL. A transaction is a sequence of SQL statements treated as a single unit. If something goes wrong, you can roll back; if all good, commit. This ensures ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).

Key points:

- TCL commands help handle commits, rollbacks, and savepoints.
- They're often used with DML commands (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) since those change data.
- In some databases like MySQL, transactions need explicit start with BEGIN or START TRANSACTION.
- Hitesh explains this well in the context of real-world scenarios like banking.

## Main TCL Commands

Here are the key ones with explanations and examples.

### 1. COMMIT

- **Purpose**: Saves all changes made in the current transaction permanently.
- **Example**: After inserting or updating, commit to make it stick.
- Notes: Once committed, you can't rollback.

### 2. ROLLBACK

- **Purpose**: Undoes all changes in the current transaction, restoring to the last commit or start.
- **Example**: If an error occurs during updates, rollback to avoid partial changes.
- Notes: Useful for error handling.

### 3. SAVEPOINT

- **Purpose**: Sets a point within a transaction to which you can rollback partially.
- **Example**: Create a savepoint after some operations, then rollback to it if needed.
- Notes: Allows finer control in complex transactions.
