## Overview

The goal of this repository is to consolidate everything I have learned in full stack development in one place. It includes:

* Topic-wise practice (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, etc.)
* Mini-projects and experiments to solidify concepts
* Larger end-to-end projects combining multiple technologies
* Notes and references for revision

## Technologies Covered

* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, Django
* **Databases:** MongoDB, MySQL
* **Other Tools:** Git, REST APIs, JWT Authentication, TypeScript

## Projects

Some of the notable projects in this repository include:

* **Portfolio Website** – A personal portfolio built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* **Amazon Clone** – Static frontend replica using HTML and CSS.
* **Currency Converter** – Built with React and API integration.
* **Authentication System** – Node.js and MongoDB implementation with JWT.

(Each project folder includes its own README with setup instructions.)
